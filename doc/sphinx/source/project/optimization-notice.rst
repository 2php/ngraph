Optimization Notice
###################

Notice revision #20110804: Intel's compilers may or may not optimize to the same degree for 
non-Intel microprocessors for optimizations that are not unique to Intel microprocessors. 
These optimizations include SSE2, SSE3, and SSSE3 instruction sets and other optimizations. 
Intel does not guarantee the availability, functionality, or effectiveness of any optimization 
on microprocessors not manufactured by Intel. Microprocessor-dependent optimizations in this 
product are intended for use with Intel microprocessors. Certain optimizations not specific 
to Intel microarchitecture are reserved for Intel microprocessors. Please refer to the 
applicable product User and Reference Guides for more information regarding the specific 
instruction sets covered by this notice.
